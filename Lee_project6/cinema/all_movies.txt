All three films—Sound of Metal, CODA, and Sweet Nothing in My Ear—
share a common thread in their exploration of Deaf culture, accessibility, and the 
emotional challenges that come with hearing loss or living in a world not built for the Deaf community.

Sound of Metal follows a touring heavy-metal drummer who abruptly begins to lose his hearing. 
The setting spans loud concert venues, cramped tour vans, and finally a peaceful, communal Deaf rehabilitation center. 
The film focuses on identity, the panic of loss, and the journey of adapting to 
Deaf culture as something meaningful and complete—not something that needs to be fixed.

CODA, an acronym for Child of Deaf Adults, centers on Ruby, the only hearing member in a Deaf family. 
The story takes place in a coastal fishing town and highlights the tensions between family obligations and personal ambitions. 
CODA beautifully illustrates the intersection of Deaf culture and hearing life, 
showing the richness of Deaf communication while exploring what it means to be a bridge between two worlds.

Sweet Nothing in My Ear is a made-for-TV drama that explores a family's difficult decision regarding whether to give their Deaf child a cochlear implant. 
The story is set in a modern suburban household and courtroom, showcasing the conflict between technological solutions and cultural preservation. 
It delves into parental roles, societal assumptions, and how families navigate deeply personal medical and cultural choices.

Each film provides a unique lens into the lives of Deaf individuals and families, 
offering not just emotional depth, but also a cultural education for hearing audiences.
